I'm not an epidemiologist, just a software engineer.  

Inspired by [this page](https://forum.bayesia.us/t/p8hymxb/webinar-series-reasoning-under-uncertainty-part-3-epidemic-modeling-with-temporal-bayesian-networks), I created a simple simulation of a COVID-19-like pandemic in the US.

[Run the Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/stanmohler/SimplePandemicSim/blob/main/SimplePandemicSim.ipynb) to see the complete explanation, run the simulation, and see plots of the results.
